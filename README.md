# Object-Detection-Using-Random-Forest-And-Decision-Tree
This is not a professional project it is a college project I made in 3 days for AI Course Feel free to use it and understand it.
You can contact me if you need any help figuring it out 
There is also a Neural Network Module.
The main file which runs the whole project is x.py other files are temp files to test things
The accuracy of Decision Tree with 500 image in training was 80.2%
The accuracy of Random Forest with 500 image in training was 96.5%
There is no localization in the project only detection
